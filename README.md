# React Patterns

A repository demonstrating common patterns found in react.
Each directory is a small demonstration of the following patterns: 
* Render Props
* Higher Order Components
* Context API (>16.3)
* Hooks API (>16.8)

Each directory within `/src/patterns` has a decriptive README.md that gives an overview of each topic.
